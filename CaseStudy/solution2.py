# 2. Even after trying for so many times, your friend’s startup could not find the investment. So you decided to take this matter
#    in your hand and try to find the list of investors who probably can invest in your friend’s startup. Your list will increase
#    the chance of your friend startup getting some initial investment by contacting these investors. Find the top 5 investors who
#    have invested maximum number of times (consider repeat investments in one company also). In a startup, multiple investors might
#    have invested. So consider each investor for that startup. Ignore undisclosed investors.
